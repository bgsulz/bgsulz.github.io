### About this website

This is a Jekyll website using a highly personalized theme. You can find the source code [here on my GitHub.](https://github.com/bgsulz/bgsulz.github.io)

### About the content

- I wrote every letter of text on this website without the assistance of LLMs (large language models; that is, auto-regressive transformer models that generate language. For example: OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama.) 
- I created every pixel of every image on this website without assistance of GANs (generative adversarial networks,) diffusion models (commonly called image generation models; for example, Midjourney's proprietary model, Black Forest Labs's F.LUX, OpenAI's DALL-E,) or multimodal transformer models (for example: OmniGen's model, OpenAI's GPT-4o.) 
- I created every second of sound and music on this website without the assistance of music generation models (that is, diffusion transformers trained on music and audio. For example: ElevenLabs's text-to-sound model, Suno's music model, Udio's music model.)

I am not unequivocally opposed to the usage of generative deep learning models; however, you deserve to know that my work is my own. If in the future I employ one of the models listed above in any way, I will be transparent about the extent of and reasoning for its usage. I would never claim to have played a virtual string instrument or hand-painted a piece of digital artwork; similarly, I will never attempt to disguise machine-generated work as mine. If you would like to discuss further, get in touch.
