I composed the themes and interstitial music for the Dear Literature podcast, a student-run book discussion show.

The podcast hosts instructed me to evoke charming fantasyâ€“cozy cottages, toadstool fields, and so on. I accomplished this with warm, shifting harmony bound together by sticky bassoon and string melodies.

All instruments are sampled or synthesized, as neither time nor budget permitted me to record live performances. Instead, this music demonstrates my ability to quickly compose and produce in-the-box in non-electronic styles.
