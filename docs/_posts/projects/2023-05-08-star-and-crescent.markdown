For the 2022-2023 academic year, I was the graphic designer for Star & Crescent, Wesleyan University's premier on-campus eating club. I refactored their brand around the logo and created digitally distributed menus with an eye towards classiness without pretense.

<p class="pbox">The priority of my branding design was clarity, and this intention dictated nearly every choice. The S&C logo includes fine details and tiny additional type, so I designed a simplified version suitable for use at small sizes.</p>

Victor Mono, an airy monospace font with optionally ornamented italics, was my choice for the menus' type hierarchy. Distinguishing between primary and secondary text was especially critical: menu items were often long, and separating the main idea from its ingredient list kept everything easy to parse.

<p class="pbox">S&C hosted a diverse menu that catered to vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free eating habits alike; often, these were optional modifications of standard menu items. Extending the brand's standard green to include a range of earthy colors, I developed a "badge" system, making it easy to understand complex qualities like "vegetarian by default, but with a vegan option"*at a glance.</p>

## Menu samples

Below, find three menu samples: two in a standard "printable" format and one in a digital gallery format.

By halfway through the semester, S&C was exclusively distributing their menus via Instagram. I took advantage of this by splitting the content across six slides, which vastly improved legibility.
