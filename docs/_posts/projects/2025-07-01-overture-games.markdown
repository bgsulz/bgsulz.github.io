In 2025, I was contracted by [Overture Games](https://www.overture.games/) to design and develop educational music games for their Chicago-based education programs. Over the course of a few development sprints totaling about 2.5 months, I developed and shipped twelve educational games: eight using Unity, three using JS/TypeScript and the Kaplay framework, and one using plain JS.

Here they are!

<br/>

## Rocket Race

#### Multiplayer - Unity

A teacher-led audio quiz covering a range of musical subjects: instrument identification, ear training, popular genres, classical repertoire, and more. This was the first game I made for Overture -- I turned it around in 3 days as part of a work trial, and it remains their go-to offering.

<br/>

## Melopede Caves

#### Singleplayer - Unity

A zany melody-writing level-based puzzle game about mysterious jewel-like bugs in a labyrinthine cave. This was a spin on an existing Overture game; I revised the design significantly and remade it from scratch.

<br/>

## Beat Decoder

#### Singleplayer - Unity

A sci-fi hacker-themed rhythm game teaching the basic workflow of using a DAW: recording, editing, and sequencing.

<br/>
![Rhythm Rally](../../assets/overture/RhythmRally.png)

## Rhythm Rally

#### Multiplayer - Unity

A multiplayer competitive rhythm game that tests your ability to keep the beat. Tear down an endless rhythmic highway in the desert -- if your car spins out, keep playing to create distractions to throw off your opponents! This was a remake of a previous version of Rhythm Rally, which was 2D and lacked the desert highway theming.

<br/>
![Yeet the Scoop](../../assets/overture/YeetTheScoop.png)

## Yeet the Scoop

#### Singleplayer - Unity

A serve-em-up ice cream store simulator a la Papa's Freezeria, but you're assembling scoop-shaped notes into chords! This game eases players into understanding how notes combine to form different chords with different qualities. This is the third version of Yeet the Scoop; I refined the design significantly and rebuilt the game from scratch (though I can't take credit for the idea to use familiar characters as patrons!)

<br/>
![React Attack](../../assets/overture/ReactAttack.png)

## React Attack

#### Multiplayer/Jackbox-style - Unity

A Jackbox-style game that teaches musical form by letting kids "react" with memes to different parts of a song. Can you remember which meme goes with which section?

<br/>
![Harmonidome](../../assets/overture/Harmonidome.png)

## Harmonidome

#### Multiplayer/Jackbox-style - Unity

A musical throwdown! Colorful instrument-shaped robots play their circuits out and students vote on the champions. At the end, all the winners play together as a band! A light-hearted game that familiarizes younger students with the tenets of musical arrangement.

<br/>
![Tuna](../../assets/overture/Tuna.png)

## Tuna

#### Singleplayer - Unity

Use your voice or your instrument to navigate a tuna fish through a perilous rip-current. This game uses your microphone: when the pitch gets higher, so does the fish! I made this game in response to a simple prompt: "Flappy Bird, but guitar tuner."

<br/>
![Real or AI](../../assets/overture/RealOrAI.png)

## Real or AI

#### Singleplayer - Kaplay

The sole non-music game I've made for Overture so far, this is a gentle, gamified introduction to the various "tells" of AI-generated imagery. I made this as a proof-of-concept for an experimental new tech curriculum.

<br/>
![Chordstruction](../../assets/overture/Chordstruction.png)

## Chordstruction

#### Singleplayer - Kaplay

Build a lovely musical street with arcadey tower-dropping mechanics -- once you're through, hear the whole thing play back as a chord progression!

<br/>
![Scale the Tower](../../assets/overture/ScaleTheTower.png)

## Scale the Tower

#### Singleplayer - Kaplay

A classic story: play as a brave knight climbing an immense tower to rescue a forlorn princess at the top. Each foothold is a note, and not all of them are stable: stick to the notes of a scale to keep yourself safe!

<br/>
![Piano Clicker](../../assets/overture/PianoClicker.png)

## Piano Clicker

#### Singleplayer - JS

An incremental clicker game: learn your way around the keyboard by playing intervals, scales, chords, and melodies! I was responsible for punching up the visuals and animations in this game.
