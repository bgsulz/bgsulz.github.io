Phrazy is a new daily puzzle game that's like a crossword, but for phrases. Assemble words from a bank into a grid, making sure that all adjacent pairs form two-word phrases or compound words.

This is my follow-up to [Lyrically:]({% post_url /projects/2024-09-15-lyrically %}) a more challenging and sophisticated word puzzler.

## How does it work?

Phrazy works similarly to Lyrically, with a Firestore database of phrases and puzzles that live-updates from a Google Sheet and a Flutter frontend. Its source code is [on GitHub here.](https://github.com/bgsulz/Phrazy)

As making puzzles is more involved for Phrazy than Lyrically, I created another "puzzle generator" Google Sheet that converts a grid of cells into a string representations of boards and word banks. Maybe I'll make a proper editor someday, but for the early stages of Phrazy, this Google Sheet solution is reliable, robust, and easy to share with other people interested in making their own puzzles.
