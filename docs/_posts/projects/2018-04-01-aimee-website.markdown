During the 2018 election cycle, I was hired by Connecticut State Senate candidate Aimee Berger-Girvalo to create a one page informational website for her campaign. I elected to showcase her excellent promotional photography in simple, stylish frames of Democratic Party blue.

I created the site using a combination of custom stylesheets and a visual page builder for Wordpress, which enabled the campaign's press managers to update the site with additional information while retaining stylistic consistency.
