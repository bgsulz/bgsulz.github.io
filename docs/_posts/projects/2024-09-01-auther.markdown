Auther is a codeword generation app for combatting identity cloning scams.

- When you're in person with people close to you, scan each other's QR codes to register each other on the Auther app.
- Then, when you chat remotely, tell each other the secret codewords generated by the Auther app.

At the moment, Auther is only available for Android. You can [get it now from GitHub](https://github.com/bgsulz/Auther/releases) (I recommend using [Obtanium.](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/)) It will arrive on open-source app stores (e.g. F-Droid) shortly, then Google Play, then the iOS App Store.

## Features

- TOTP-style codeword generation.
- QR code generation and scanning.
- "Emergency mode" (in case a registered person can't access their device, you can enter their secret passphrase instead of their codewords.)
- Edit, remove, and search through the app's list of registered people.

## Why does this app exist?

The age of zero-cost deepfakes is imminent. (See links below.) Some are already abusing this technology to run imposter scams. If you're reading this, you can probably sniff out a deepfake -- but can all your relatives and friends?

Using a single secret codeword may not be enough; if intercepted or guessed, your system is compromised. Auther perpetually updates your digital signature, enabling remote communication with confidence.

## How does it work?

Conceptually, it's not terribly complicated.

- When you start the app, you must set a secret passphrase. You'll use this to log into the app.
- Your secret passphrase is hashed and discarded.
- Your QR code sends the hash of your passphrase; scanning someone else's QR code adds their hash to a list.
- The codewords are derived from another hash: `hash(userHash + otherHash + currentTime)` where `currentTime` refreshes every 30 seconds.

## How did you make it?

Auther is built with Flutter.

## "Get real. These scams are a non-issue."

See links below. The best case scenario is that this whole project turns out to be useless. I'd be quite happy about that.
