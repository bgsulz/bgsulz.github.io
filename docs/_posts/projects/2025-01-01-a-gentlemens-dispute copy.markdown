Since 2023, I've been working with Blast Furnace games as sound designer and assistant programmer. Since early 2024, most of my work for Blast Furnace has focused on *A Gentlemen's Dispute*, an old-fashioned slapstick multiplayer party brawler.

- I've created several hundred sound effects for *A Gentlemen's Dispute*, ranging from **subtle footsteps** and fabric movements to violent **cartoon explosions** to tactile **UI interactions.** 
- I made the vast majority of these sounds by layering and manipulating public domain foley recordings. 
- I'm also responsible for implementing and mixing the sounds in **FMOD Studio.** 

You can hear a handful of these sounds in the game's trailer below:

I've aimed for a tactile, semi-cartoonish aesthetic that's gently silly without becoming obnoxious.
- Blast Furnace has discovered that players keep coming back to *A Gentlemen's Dispute*, so ensuring that the sound effects don't grate after dozens of hours of play is a priority.
- The "punchline" of *A Gentlemen's Dispute* is its upgrade system's intense capacity to scale -- with the right build, one bear trap can multiply into hundreds, or cannons can fire autonomously for nearly a minute. Sound effects that were unpleasant or upsetting to hear over and over would suck the fun out of the game!
