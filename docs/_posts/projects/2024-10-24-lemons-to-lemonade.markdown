I was contracted to create a brand and designs for Lemons to Lemonade, a wellness board game for teachers and therapists to play with children.

The game plays similarly to Candy Land or Monopoly: the player's piece moves from space to space along a path. In order to earn the privilege of rolling the die, however, the player must draw a Lemon card, which has some difficulty or struggle written on the back, and "turn it into lemonade" by finding a silver lining. For example, the card

> I get nervous speaking in front of people.

might be converted to lemonade as such:

> At least there are a lot of people who listen to me and who find my ideas important!

## Style

My client provided me with a handful of painterly, hand-drawn references, and suggested that I use yellow, blue, and green as the color palette. The words **clean, fresh,** and **friendly** emerged as guides.

## Illustrations

Using Affinity Designer, I developed a style that evokes the playful mixed media experiments of elementary-school drawings; it's a hybrid of smooth marker lines, textured chalk, and blocks of goache-style acrylic.

In this style, I produced a handful of sticker-like illustrations and a vintage-style logo reminiscent of a childhood tradition: a lemonade stand! Rapidly iterating upon the design in response to client feedback, I settled on a screamingly high-saturation color palette and set the brand elements atop breezy, textured backgrounds that lets the illustrations' simple silhouettes pop.

> I would have loved to draw these designs on paper and scan them! Unfortunately, I was working on a quick turnaround, so I had to make do with an all-digital design inspired by physical media.

## Promotional Materials

My client had a promotional event for the game shortly after I completed the design. For distribution at this event, I created layouts for a variety of on-brand print materials, including business cards, flyers, and a large foam core sign.
