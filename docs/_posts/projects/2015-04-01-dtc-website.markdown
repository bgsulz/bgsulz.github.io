In 2015, I was hired to create the very first website for the Ridgefield Democratic Town Committee. I opted for a heavily customized Wordpress configuraton, which empowered the DTC to easily publish articles, events, and other content.

The style of the website puts calls to action front and center, with large, engaging photographs, an accessible event calendar, and an eye-catching donation button.
