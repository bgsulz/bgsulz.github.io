## Hang in there, thirsty bird.

It gets hot out in the desert. So what's a flightless chick to do but rely on the mercurial blessings of the clouds above? Hang in there, thirsty bird; the sands are alive, and you might just find an unlikely ally lurking beneath.

## A retro-ish rhythm-ish game about catching raindrops.

Dodge, weave, and catch with an unusual two-level control scheme. Use the rhythm of the skies to help your timing. Go with the flow and let your hands learn to work together. It feels a little like learning a musical instrument. This game is hard to master, but the levels are gentle -- you can do it! 


## Catchy little tunes to keep you in the zone.
