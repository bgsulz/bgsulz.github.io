In high school, I was the sole design editor for the ambitious print reboot of our online news magazine, _The Ridgefielder._ Using first Sketch and then InDesign as our quarterly installments scaled in length, I designed and refined the magazine's design identity over the course of two years.

The result is youthfully colorful and geometric, but austere; I aimed to provide the student writers' essays and reports with a backdrop that was eye-catching but mature. Its dots and shapes echo the amply decorated classroom, while its stark minimalism draws attention among the lineoleum-and-brick patchwork of the hall.
