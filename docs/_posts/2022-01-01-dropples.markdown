_Dropples_ is a virtual board game for two players. Compete with a friend in local multiplayer strategy.

The rules are simple: 
- On each player's turn, they must perform two actions. 
- An action is: moving a piece, building a block next to a piece, or pushing a block next to a piece.
- Pieces can be eliminated when pushed off the edge or crushed with a block. Eliminate your opponent's pieces.

Between the easy-to-grasp ruleset and close-quartered playfield, games are brisk and light.

I developed _Dropples_ in Unity based on a prototype made in Processing (Java.)
