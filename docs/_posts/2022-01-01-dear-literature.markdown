I composed the themes and interstitial music for the Dear Literature podcast, a student-run book discussion show.

The podcast hosts instructed me to evoke charming fantasyâ€“cozy cottages, toadstool fields, and so on. I accomplished this with warm, shifting harmony bound together by sticky bassoon and string melodies.

All instruments are digital and in-the-box, as neither time nor budget permitted me to record live instrumentalists. Instead, this music is demonstrates my ability to work in challenging styles, even when limited by the equipment available.
