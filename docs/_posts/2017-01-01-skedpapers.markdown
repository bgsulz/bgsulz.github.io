My high school had a complex eight-day rotating schedule. Each day in the eight-day cycle had a letter -- **A** through **H** -- and each letter correlated to a different ordering of classes.

It was _so challenging_ to memorize this schedule that many students took a screenshot of their schedule page from the online student portal and set it as the wallpaper for their phone's lock screen. You'd have to wrestle the information around the lock screen's digital clock and notification icons, resulting in unwieldy crops and fuzzy text.

My solution was Skedpapers, an automated wallpaper-generation program built with Processing 3. My classmates picked the color, shape, and label of each of their classes, and the program generated a beautiful and legible schedule atop the background image of their choice.
