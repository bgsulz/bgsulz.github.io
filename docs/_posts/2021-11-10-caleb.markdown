c.a.l.e.b. (Canine Aid Locale Exploration Bot) is a submission to the 2021 GMTK Game Jam -- theme "Joined Together." It is a puzzle platformer where the player character can split in two and rejoin. I worked as primary artist and gameplay programmer on a team of three.

The original concept for c.a.l.e.b. itself originated during a class at Wesleyan University -- Computational Media: Videogame Development (IDEA350.) One of my team members and I collaborated on an original character designed to communicate a unique video game mechanic. c.a.l.e.b. 1.0 grappled across metal walls and ceilings with magnetic hands, separating and rejoining to navigate difficult terrain.

To augment the minimal visuals, I paired the game's crunchy lo-res rendering with a flipbook-style squigglevision postprocessing effect. In conjunction with its lax approach to puzzle-solving, the game's visual style is scrappy and loose.

The game placed in the top 5% of submissions.
